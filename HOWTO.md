# How to use

To use the Hideout Helper you need to provide two .hideout files.
The first is, obviously, the one you want to import. The second one contains all decoration you already own.
<br><br>

## How to find out which decorations I already own

This is pretty easy. Just move to your hideout and import the Hideout you want to use. Beware that you may need to switch your hideout at Helena first.
<br><br>
You will notice a lot of warnings that the hideout requires more doodads.
Now just press the "Export"-Button in Path of Exile and save the file next to the one you want to import. You may name it "ownedDoodads.hideout".
<br><br>
Now you have both files you need and can use the tool. 
First choose the Hideout you want to import, 
second the file you exported recently. 
Select the language of you game client and press "Lets go". 
<br><br>

## Use the Overlay

An overlay opens which sends you to a Master. Go to that Master and select "Purchase Decorations".
Now you can press "Start" on the overlay or press F10. Every button shows the Hotkey you can use.
<br><br>
The first item you need to buy will be highlighted, and the overlay shows how many you need.
Buy the Decorations and press "Next Item" or press F11, and the next item you need will be highlighted.
<br><br>
Repeat this until you will be sent to the next Master and do the same again.
<br><br>
The overlay informs you when you are done. You can now import the Hideout you want again. Now you should see no more warnings.
If the Hideout use MTX Decorations you need to purchase the manually and import the Hideout again.
<br><br>
You can stop any time you want, but make sure you import and export the hideout again before start over to be up to date.
<br><br>

## Tips and known Problems 

**Is it possible to buy more than one decoration at once?**

No, but you can skip the confirmation dialog by CTRL+Click the item and be a lot faster.

**My Hideout layout break after importing! Objects are on the wrong place!**

This is, unfortunately, a problem from Path of Exile. 
You can read more about it in the Forum: https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2685131
<br><br>
The client is _saving_ the position intractable objects (Master, Stash, Waypoint,...) different as normal decorations.
If you import a hideout, the position of the Waypoint for example will simply not updated by the client.
<br><br>
You can fix this really easy: If you recognize, that there are moving after re-enter you Hideout, simply re-import the hideout again. 
Then click in "Edit" and move the Waypoint (or other NPCs) just back and forth with the arrows keys. This will save the position permanently.
Mostly this just affects some Objects, but you have to do it with every object that resets back :(

**I still get "This template requires mode doodads" even after purchasing everything?!**

This is, again, a problem from Path of Exile.<br>
You may notice, even with this message, the purchased doodads are placed. 
You need to-enter your hideout (or even login again) to update the "decorations-i-already-own"-list stored in the client cache. 
After re-entering the messages disappear.

**I cannot see the overlay**

The overlay only works in Window- or WindowedFullscreen-Mode.
