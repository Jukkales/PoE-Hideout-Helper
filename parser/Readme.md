# HideoutHelper Resource Converter

This submodule uses the extracted files of the games Content.ggpk to generate the required files ``decorations.dat``, ``hideouts.dat`` and ``music.dat``.

## HowTo

- Install and Configure [PyPoE](https://github.com/OmegaK2/PyPoE)
- Run the ``export.bat`` in the resourceFolder (or run all commands inside)
- Start the Loader-Class

## Why

We do this to have all data as up to date as possible and not be dependent on external APIs.
